<h1 class="page_header">How to Make Pizza Dough</h1>

<h2 class="page_subheading">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="page_content">
            <li>2 1/4 cups plain flour (plus extra for dusting)</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil (optional)</li>
            <li>1 tsp active dry yeast</li>
            <li>3/4 cup warm water (around 110°F/45°C)</li>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil (for greasing)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="page_subheading">Instructions</h2>
        
        <h2 class="page_subheading">Activate the yeast</h2>
        <p class="page_content">
            In a small bowl, mix the warm water, sugar, and active dry yeast. Stir until the yeast dissolves and let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy. If it doesn’t bubble, the yeast might be expired, so try again with fresh yeast.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="page_subheading">Make the dough</h2>
        <p class="page_content">
            In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Once the yeast mixture is frothy, pour it into the bowl with the flour. Add the olive oil (if using). Stir with a spoon or your hands until the dough begins to come together.
        </p>
        <p class="page_content">
            Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead for about 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic. If the dough is sticky, add a little more flour, a tablespoon at a time.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="page_subheading">Let the dough rise</h2>
        <p class="page_content">
            Grease a clean bowl with a little olive oil and place the dough in it, turning the dough once to coat it in oil. Cover the bowl with a damp towel or plastic wrap and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-1.5 hours, or until it has doubled in size.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="page_subheading">Shape the dough</h2>
        <p class="page_content">
            Once the dough has risen, punch it down gently to release any air bubbles. Divide the dough into 2 portions for smaller pizzas or keep it as one large portion for a bigger pizza. Roll out the dough on a floured surface until it reaches your desired thickness (about 10-12 inches in diameter for a standard pizza).
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="page_subheading">Preheat the oven</h2>
        <p class="page_content">
            Preheat your oven to its highest setting, around 475°F (245°C), for at least 30 minutes. If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven while preheating.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="page_subheading">Assemble the pizza</h2>
        <p class="page_content">
            Transfer the rolled-out dough onto a parchment paper or lightly floured pizza peel. Add your desired toppings and bake for about 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="page_subheading">Serve</h2>
        <p class="page_content">
            Slice, serve, and enjoy!

# Blog
I've made this blog just for fun and educational purposes as I learn how to code. If you like it, want to adapt it or repurpose for your own project - feel free! It started as a very simple HTML and CSS file, where I would create HTML blog posts with a fixed format. When creating a new blog I would duplicate one of the blog posts and change all the imput fields with the new information from my IDE. With the help of Claude Code and some deep diving I was able to build a JavaScript that would allow me to create blog posts in Obsidian, and have them automatically pushed, converted to HTML from Markdown and published on the website without touching a button. It's a very simple system - using the Git pluggin in Obsidian I cloned my repo, then I made a fixed template for blogs. All I do then is create a new page, use the blog template, move it to my 'Blogs' folder in Obsidian and the git pluggin automatically stages, commits, and pushes live to the Github repo. Then the workflow automation runs in Github, taking the Markdown file and creating a converted copy in html, which it then posts live. 

Feel free to use this or ask questions if you need help!
